# Annotations

The rules defined in the `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}` grammars are run over annotated text, which is generated by a [`Processor`](https://github.com/clulab/processors/blob/master/main/src/main/scala/org/clulab/processors/Processor.scala) to produce an annotated [`Document`](https://github.com/clulab/processors/blob/master/main/src/main/scala/org/clulab/processors/Document.scala) instance that can be serialized to JSON. Example JSON output for the text "How many TEUs of Frozen Meat are heading to Hamburg?" can be found in [this Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/zwellington/21688441b3d8a62f8e2f2051e1792a63).

## Processors

Currently there are three processors avalaible to the REST API: `Custom`, `CluProcessor`, and `ProxiedProcessor`. 

### `CustomProcessor`
The `Custom` processor uses a mixture of components from the [`clulab/processors`](https://github.com/clu-ling/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/blob/master/reader/src/main/scala/{{ cookiecutter.class_path.replace('.','/') }}/mr/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/processors/CustomProcessor.scala) library with custom pre- and post-processing hooks.  

### `CluProcessor` 
`CluProcessor` comes directly from [`clulab/processors`](https://github.com/clulab/processors/blob/master/main/src/main/resources/cluprocessor.conf). 

### `ProxiedProcessor`

The `ProxiedProcessor` performs annotation via REST calls and allowing the user to easily mix components written in different programming languages.  The `ProxiedProcessor` is defined in [`reader/src/main/scala/{{ cookiecutter.class_path.replace('.','/') }}/mr/processors`](https://github.com/clu-ling/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/blob/master/reader/src/main/scala/{{ cookiecutter.class_path.replace('.','/') }}/mr/processors/ProxiedProcessor.scala). One can use [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) for annotation via the [`clu-spacy` library](https://github.com/clu-ling/clu-spacy)).
