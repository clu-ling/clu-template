# clu-template

`clu-template` is a repository template for clu projects. To generate a new clu project from this template, use the following line in the desired directory for the new project.

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/clu-ling/clu-template.git
```

Prompts will occur for `repo_name`, `package_name`, and `package_image_name`, simply input the correct values for the new project.

<!-- All packages initialized with 0.1 versioning, info.py will need to be updated for description, authors, contact, and license.

Initialized with `example-script`, a dummy script which can be removed.

requirements.txt is rendered with dependencies typical to clu projects, this file will need to be updated for the specific project dependencies.
